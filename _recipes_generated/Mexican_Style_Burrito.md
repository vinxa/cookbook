# Mexican_Style_Burrito

## Ingredients

- *75 g* cheddar cheese
- *1* lime
- *1* lime
- *6 large* tortillas
- *2* fresh red chilli
- *30 g* butter
- *8 large* eggs
- salt
- black pepper
- [Red Beans](Shared/Red Beans)
- [Guacamole](Shared/Guacamole)
- *200 ml* sour cream
- *1 pinch* smoked paprika

## Cookware

- small non-stick saucepan
- bowl
- spatula

## Steps

1. Coarsely grate the cheddar cheese. Cut lime in half and the other lime into
six wedges.

2. Loosely wrap the tortillas in tin foil then pop in the hot oven to warm
through, along with two plates. Finely chop the fresh red chilli and put it
aside for later.

3. Make your table look respectable - get the cutlery, salt and pepper and
drinks laid out nicely.

4. Put a small non-stick saucepan on a low heat. Add the butter and leave to
melt.

5. Crack the eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and black pepper and beat
with a fork.

6. When the butter has melted, add the eggs to the pan. Stir the eggs slowly
with a spatula, getting right into the sides of the pan. Cook gently for 5 to
10 minutes until they just start to scramble then turn the heat off - they'll
continue to cook on their own.

7. Get two plates and pop a warm tortilla on each one. Divide the scrambled eggs
between them then top with a good spoonful of your home-made Red Beans.

8. Scatter each portion with grated cheese and as much chilli as you dare, then
roll each tortilla up.

9. Spoon Guacamole and sour cream on top of each one, scatter with coriander
leaves and dust with a little smoked paprika.

10. Serve each portion with wedge of lime for squeezing over, and tuck in.
