# Sicilian-style_Scottadito_Lamb_Chops

## Ingredients

- *8 large* lamb chops
- *2 cloves* garlic
- *1 tsp* fennel seeds
- *2 sprigs* fresh oregano
- *1 splash* extra virgin olive oil
- *pinch* salt
- *pinch* ground cinnamon
- lemon
- salt
- black pepper

## Steps

1. Light the barbecue and let it get nice and hot. Make sure the bars of the
barbecue are clean and free from any burnt on residue.

2. Take the lamb chops out of the fridge and place on a plate to come up to room
temperature. Meanwhile...

3. Peel the garlic. Bash the fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar until finely
ground.

4. Pick and add the leaves from fresh oregano, the garlic, extra virgin olive
oil and salt and bash again.

5. Stir in the ground cinnamon, zest the lemon over the top and mix again. Tip
into a roasting tray and spread out.

6. Lightly splash the fat in several places along the chops.

7. Place the chops in one layer on a board, season well with salt and black
pepper then bash and flatten slightly with the base of a small saucepan.

8. Transfer the chops to the roasting tray, then turn over in the marinade to
coat, then leave to marinate for around 30 minutes.

9. When the bars of the grill are nice and hot, drop the chops onto the hot side
and sear on both sides for 2 minutes, or until browned all over (move the chops
away from any flames that appear).

10. Cut the lemon in half with a clean knife, and squeeze over the chops for the
last minute of cooking, then transfer to a plate to rest before serving.
