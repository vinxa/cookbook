# Easy_Pancakes

#breakfast

## Ingredients

- *3* eggs
- *125 g* flour
- *250 ml* milk
- *pinch* sea salt
- *drizzle* olive oil

## Steps

1. Crack the eggs into a blender, then add the flour, milk and sea salt, and
blitz until smooth.

2. Pour into a bowl and leave to stand for 15 minutes.

3. Melt olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, then tilt
the pan so the butter coats the surface.

4. Pour in 1 ladle of batter and tilt again, so that the batter spreads all
over the base, then cook for 1 - 2 minutes, or until it starts to come away from
the sides.

5. Once golden underneath, flip the pancake over and cook for 1 further minute
or until cooked through.

6. Serve straight away with your favourite topping.
